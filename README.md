These are some C implementations of basic data structures, with some algorithms for them.
To implement a data structure, I add some basic functions for "construction" and manipuilation.
Some of the algorithms are solutions to problems that I found in the internet. The ideas to solve
these problems are certainly not original (at least the most part of them).
In some cases, I used some idea I read somewhere in the past.  
Most part of the basic implementations follows from what I learned from Professor Isabel Rosseti, at Universidade Federal
Fluminense (Niter√≥i - RJ - Brazil), in the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course. 

The most interesting files are BinarySearchTree.c and HuffmanCoding.c. 

I hope I will keep updating this project with new data structures. Right now, February 2023, the file
Graphs.c, for example, is highly incomplete. At this moment, there is nothing on Hashing, also. Even more, 
it would be good to have some more intrincated trees (like AVL trees and B-trees, for example). 

Please feel free to use anything you want from this project. This is all done for didactic purposes.
